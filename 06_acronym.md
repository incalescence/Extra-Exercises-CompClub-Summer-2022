Content Hints: for loops, if statements, in operator

Given a string, create an acronym from that string. Acronyms should only contain capitalised versions of the first letter in every word of the string. Any other symbols or numbers should be ignored.

```bash
Enter string: World health orgANIsation
Acronym is WHO
>>>
Enter string: ABC 1 2 3 @@
Acronym is A
```
