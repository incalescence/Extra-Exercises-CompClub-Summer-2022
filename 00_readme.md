Each .md file contains an extra exercise! They've been ordered from easiest to hardest (subjective ranking though, take it with a pinch of salt!)
There will be instrucions as well as hints about what content you might need to use.

- Most of these exercises will make use of what we have learnt today. Some other knowledge may be needed (feel free to google a bit if you get stuck!) to complete some of the more challenging questions. 
- Some of these exercises don't have a strict sample output you neeed to follow. In general, focus on coding the concepts correctly rather than worrying about the format in which you may print your answers in!

- You may need to make use of quit() if you want to end your program early

- Feel free to make another repl or code in main.py to run your program
