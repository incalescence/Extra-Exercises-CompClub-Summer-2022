# CSESoc CompClub Summer School 2022
[Jan 2022]
<br>
I was so fortunate to be a volunteer mentor at CSESoc CompClub's flagship Summer School. 
Throughout the week, I a led a group of eager high school students in the following workshops:
* Intro to Python
* Web Development 
<br>
Over the 2 days, I assisted in debugging students' code, recapping topics covered in the presentation
, researching extension exercises and overall keeping the vibes fun and relaxed â™«.
It was thoroughly rewarding to witness the students' improvement over the short duration and I'm really grateful for this experience.
