Content Hints: print(), while loops, bools

Write a program that asks the user to think of a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The program should then repeatedly guess a number, and have the user say whether the guess is too low, too high or correct. 

Have a careful look at how the program makes its guess based on the input given. 

Example:

```bash
Pick a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
My guess is: 50
Is my guess too low (L), too high (H), or correct (C)?
L
My guess is: 75
Is my guess too low (L), too high (H), or correct (C)?
H
My guess is: 62
Is my guess too low (L), too high (H), or correct (C)?
C
Got it!
```

This program had the following standard input passed to it
```bash
L
H
C
```
