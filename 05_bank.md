Content Hints: while loops, if/elif/else statements

Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based on a transaction log that the user gives. The transaction log format should be entered like this:

D 100

W 200

D means deposit while W means withdrawal.

The program should keep on asking 'Enter log: ' until a blank is given. It should then print out the net amount in the bank account. 

Sample output:
```bash
Enter log: D 300
Enter log: D 300
Enter log: W 200
Enter log: D 100
Enter log: 
Amount is 500
```
