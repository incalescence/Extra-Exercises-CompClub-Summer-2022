Content hints: functions, dictionaries.
You may need to think about the best way to test that your function works. (consider )

Write a function that when given a dictionary d, invert its structure such that values in d map to lists of keys in d.


For example:
- ({1: 'A', 2: 'B', 3: 'A'}) prints {'A': [1, 3], 'B': [2]}


Params:d (dict): A dictionary where all the values are hashable (i.e. can be used as keys in the result).

Returns: (dict): A dictionary with the structure described above.
